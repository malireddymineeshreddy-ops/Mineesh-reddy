FEES AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Abstract

The Fee / Financial Management System is a simple, terminal-based application developed in C to efficiently manage student fee-related records. The system enables users to add fee details, search financial records by ID or name, update existing entries, and delete outdated or incorrect fee information. All financial data—including total fee, paid fee, pending amount, and contact details—is handled using arrays and basic C operations, making the program easy to understand and suitable for beginners.

Designed with simplicity in mind, the application features a clean, menu-driven interface ideal for small educational institutions, coaching centers, and individual administrators. It demonstrates essential C programming concepts such as loops, arrays, user-defined functions, conditional statements, and menu-driven program flow. This lightweight and beginner-friendly solution provides an accessible way to manage student fee details without requiring external databases or files.
